Mechanics:
Treasure Maps lead to treasure guarded by mobs.  They're the main source of coins. 

Immediate Goals:
[x]	Add in game notification window
[x]	Spawn a fishing rod onto the ground
[x]	Player can click-drag item in the world
[x]	Player walks up to it and when within range can click-drag it into their inventory
[ ]		Upon dragging into inventory window area, it changes to fishing rod inventory icon
[ ]		It will snap to inventory slots until released
[ ]		Player can also drop it back onto the ground by click dragging from inventory 
[ ]		Upon dragging out of the inventory window, it turns back into the world icon

Add ability to just drop onto character which puts it into the first available inventory slots
Add ability to just drop right outside inventory window.  if too far from character it drops on the ground by the character.

====BACKUP NOTES====
20172609_140600:
- Working (sorta) draggable inventory.  Gonna try and change it so that the dragging only works on a specific part of the control in next build.
20170927_113300:
- Draggable inventory works perfectly now.  Next item will be implementing an actual inventory system.
20170928_152300:
- Updated Unity to 2017.1.1
20170930_130500:
